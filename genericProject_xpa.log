WARNING:Power:1337 - Clock frequency for clock net "clk_BUFGP/IBUFG" is zero.
WARNING:Power:1337 - Clock frequency for clock net "mw/clk_icap" is zero.
WARNING:Power:1369 - Clock frequency for one or more clocks was not found through

     1. The proper timing constraints (PERIOD) for clocks (re-implement design
        and load the newly generated PCF file into XPower Analyzer)
     2. A post PAR simulation-generated VCD or SAIF file indicating clock
        frequencies
